### Context
Apartments are one of the answers to the housing needs of modern society due to limited 
residential land and dense business activities in urban areas. Therefore, it will be very interesting 
to examine apartment prices influenced by various internal and external factors.  
 
Individuals or companies usually make apartment (unit) offers. Bidders can sell units on a platform 
by determining their apartmentsâ€™ prices. That way is quite difficult for apartment owners to adjust 
to market prices. If the price is too high compared to the market price, it will certainly be difficult 
to make sales. Conversely, if it is too low, the owner will find it difficult to get maximum profit.
